# 🏋️‍♂️ HERCULES – Habit Warrior

**A personalized productivity tool with a spider (radar) chart for tracking your real-life progress.**

## 🚀 Why I Built Hercules

I needed a productivity tool that truly reflected my habits and growth across multiple life domains—something visual, motivating, and customizable. Something that would motivate me, a productivity tool like none other.  
Inspired by the DAWG app’s spider chart. I was unable to find a similar tool that fit my needs, so I decided to build my own!

## 💪 Why "Hercules"?

I chose the name Hercules because it stands for legendary strength, perseverance, and the relentless pursuit of greatness.
In mythology, Hercules overcame seemingly impossible labors through discipline, courage, and resilience—qualities at the heart of personal growth and habit-building.

Just like Hercules, this app is about:
- Facing daily challenges head-on
- Turning discipline into power.
- Transforming small wins into legendary progress

The name is a daily reminder:
**Every habit you conquer is a labor that makes you stronger.**
